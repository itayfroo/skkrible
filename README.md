# Server Side Skribble
This is a multiplayer drawing and chat game built using Python, Pygame, Tkinter, and Sockets. Players take turns drawing a randomly chosen word while others try to guess it in real-time via a chat system. The game features:
A Pygame interface for drawing and selecting words.
A Tkinter chat window for messaging.
A socket-based server to handle multiplayer communication.
A scoring system, where correct guesses earn points.
A turn-based drawing system, with each round lasting 60 seconds.
Players connect to the server, receive a prompt for their name, and can chat while guessing the drawing. The first player to reach 10 points wins.
